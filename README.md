# URL Shortener

## Description

This is a personal full stack project built to allow users to enter a link and be provided with a
shortened version of the link. From there, they are able to copy this link and enter it into
their browser to be redirected to the desired website they initially made the link for!

Since this project will be open-source, anyone is able to set it up at home and use their own
server/domain to host the project and provide links to their friends and family without
using public URL Shorteners.
